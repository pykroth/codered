The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs: BP 160/95, HR 88, RR 22, O2 sat 94% on room air
General: Anxious appearing male in moderate distress
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
Extremities: No edema, pulses intact

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
- EKG: ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF consistent with inferior STEMI
- Troponin I: 15.2 ng/mL (elevated)
- CK-MB: 45 U/L (elevated)

- Echocardiogram: Ejection fraction 45%, inferior wall hypokinesis

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Patient was taken emergently to cardiac catheterization lab where he underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the right coronary artery. A drug-eluting stent was placed successfully. Post-procedure, patient was monitored in the cardiac care unit. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), inferior wall
2. Hypertension, uncontrolled
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Status post primary PCI with drug-eluting stent placement

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
- Aspirin 81mg daily
- Clopidogrel 75mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg daily
- Metoprolol 25mg twice daily
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
